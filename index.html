            <div class="summary">
                <p>Donald Trump has announced ambitious plans for his next term. These include revitalizing the economy, prioritizing energy independence, and addressing border security with more stringent policies. His focus on deregulation aims to accelerate industrial growth, while new fiscal strategies target inflation and aim to stabilize the middle class's financial footing. Trump also plans to explore digital innovation through cryptocurrency initiatives, emphasizing technological leadership. Moreover, his administration has signaled a commitment to renegotiate trade agreements to favor American industries and workers. These updates signal a bold approach to governance, aiming to redefine domestic and international policies for a stronger America.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong style="font-family: Cambria;">Ending Inflation:</strong>
                    <p>Donald Trump plans to address inflation by implementing stricter fiscal policies, reducing government spending, and focusing on deregulating industries to boost economic growth. He aims to stabilize prices and improve purchasing power for Americans. Additionally, his approach involves working closely with the Federal Reserve to manage interest rates effectively. By cutting unnecessary bureaucracy, Trump seeks to enhance productivity in key sectors of the economy. This initiative is expected to bring relief to middle-class families struggling with rising costs.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong style="font-family: Cambria;">Adding More Fossil Fuel Emissions:</strong>
                    <p>The former president is expected to roll back environmental regulations, opening up more opportunities for oil, coal, and natural gas production. He argues this will create jobs and reduce dependency on foreign energy sources. Proponents claim this policy will revitalize the energy sector and provide affordable energy to consumers. However, critics warn about the long-term environmental consequences. Trump also plans to reopen negotiations on energy trade agreements to ensure the United States becomes a leading global supplier.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong style="font-family: Cambria;">Pushing the TikTok Ban Back by 90 Days:</strong>
                    <p>Trump's administration plans to revisit the TikTok ban, granting the company a 90-day extension to address national security concerns while negotiating potential ownership changes. This extension will allow further review of data privacy measures implemented by the company. Trump believes such measures are necessary to protect American users' information. By delaying the ban, the administration seeks to give TikTok an opportunity to comply with U.S. regulations, potentially avoiding a complete shutdown.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong style="font-family: Cambria;">Starting a Meme Coin:</strong>
                    <p>Trump reportedly intends to introduce a cryptocurrency branded as a "Meme Coin" to appeal to younger voters and capitalize on the growing interest in digital assets. This coin aims to serve as a platform for fundraising and engaging supporters online. Critics have questioned its viability, citing potential regulatory challenges. Nonetheless, Trump believes this initiative could revolutionize political campaigning and bring a fresh approach to grassroots mobilization. The Meme Coin also symbolizes his push for embracing emerging technologies.</p>

                    <strong style="font-family: Cambria;">Deporting Undocumented Migrants:</strong>
                    <p>He has pledged to reinstate stricter immigration policies, prioritizing the deportation of undocumented migrants and increasing border security measures. Trump plans to allocate additional resources to immigration enforcement agencies. His administration argues that these measures will protect American jobs and ensure national security. Advocates highlight the need to address illegal immigration systematically, while opponents have raised concerns about the humanitarian implications. Balancing security with compassion remains a contentious aspect of this policy.</p>
