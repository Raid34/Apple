                <h2>End Inflation</h2>
                <p><strong>What Trump Plans to Do:</strong><br>Trump has continuously stressed that controlling inflation was a top priority, particularly after the economic challenges that followed the COVID-19 pandemic. His plan to combat inflation included implementing tax cuts for individuals and businesses, reducing government spending, and imposing tariffs on imports to bring down the price of goods.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Is Important:</strong><br>Inflation is a persistent economic issue that impacts the cost of living for millions of Americans. By slashing taxes, Trump aimed to give families more disposable income, which he believed would help mitigate the effects of rising prices. His “America First” agenda, which prioritized U.S. manufacturing, also played a role in his efforts to reduce dependence on foreign goods.</p>

                <h2>Rejecting Climate Regulations</h2>
                <p><strong>What Trump Plans to Do:</strong><br>Trump's climate policy has consistently been focused on rolling back regulations that he believes hinder economic growth. His administration had already removed several Obama-era regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions, clean energy, and environmental protections. Trump’s stance on climate change often favored fossil fuel expansion and criticized global climate agreements like the Paris Agreement.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Is Important:</strong><br>For Trump, economic growth and energy independence were top priorities. By cutting regulations, he hoped to allow businesses to grow without governmental interference, particularly in the oil, gas, and coal industries. However, this plan also raised concerns among environmentalists about the long-term impact on the planet’s health.</p>

                <h2>Ending the Ukraine War</h2>
                <p><strong>What Trump Plans to Do:</strong><br>Trump’s foreign policy on Ukraine has been to negotiate directly with Russian leadership in order to reach a peaceful resolution. He claimed that his approach would involve leveraging strong diplomacy to end the war, a sharp contrast to the strategy pursued by the Biden administration, which involves substantial military aid to Ukraine.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Is Important:</strong><br>Ending the war in Ukraine is seen as a top priority for global security. Trump’s claim that he could resolve the conflict within a day draws attention for its boldness and simplicity. Whether or not this is feasible remains unclear, but his unique approach certainly set him apart in foreign policy discussions.</p>

                <h2>Sacking the Veteran Jack Smith</h2>
                <p><strong>What Trump Plans to Do:</strong><br>Jack Smith, a former prosecutor, was appointed by the Justice Department to oversee investigations into Trump’s business dealings and alleged illegal activities. Trump has vowed to remove him, seeing the investigation as a politically motivated attack on his career.</p>
                <p><strong>Why This Is Important:</strong><br>This promise reflects Trump’s ongoing legal battles and his claims of being unfairly targeted by the justice system. By sacking Jack Smith, Trump aims to take control of investigations that he believes are part of a broader attempt to discredit him.</p>
